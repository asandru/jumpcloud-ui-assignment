# JumpCloud UI Engineer Solution

## Overview

A client directory has been added to the original project. Most of the solution code resides in here.
The server/server.js file has been modified to re-route the React App API Request/Responses to
the Express Server which will, in turn, re-route them to the third party API (JumpCloud).

## Instructions

After fetching the code from github, open two terminals
1. ```cd server```
2. ```npm install```
3. ```npm start```

and

4. ```cd client```
5. ```npm install```
6. ```npm start```

A new web browser tab will be opened with the application.
